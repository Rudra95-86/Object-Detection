# Real-Time Object Tracking in Video Streams

A comprehensive Python implementation for real-time object tracking using both classical (KCF, CSRT) and deep learning (YOLOv8 + Deep SORT) methods.

## Features

- **Dual Tracking Modes**: Compare classical (KCF, CSRT) and deep learning (YOLOv8 + Deep SORT) approaches
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for live webcam feeds with FPS monitoring
- **Interactive Interface**: Mouse and keyboard controls for easy interaction
- **Multiple Object Tracking**: Track multiple objects simultaneously
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time FPS calculation and display
